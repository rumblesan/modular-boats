# Modular Synth Boat Designs

CAD drawings for boats and relevant parts


## 4U Boat

Can be used for either 3U + 1U(Intellijel) Eurorack modules, or 4U [Loudest Warning](http://www.loudestwarning.co.uk) modules.

If using for Loudest Warning modules then don't fit the middle two rails.

#### 84HP 4U Loudest Warning

* 2 x 432mm [gie-tec mounting profile 1](https://gie-tec.de/product/19-mounting-profile1/?lang=en)
* 2 x 432mm [gie-tec housing profile 1](https://gie-tec.de/product/housing-profile1/?lang=en)
* 2 x 432mm by 60.5mm by 1.5mm aluminium side panels
* 1 x 432mm by 159.6mm by 1.5mm aluminium base panel

#### Notes

Side panel height may need to be tweaked after measuring the rails.

Side panels and Base panels should be no more than 1.6mm thick to fit into housing profile 1 slots, and allowance probably needs to be given for tolerance so 1.5mm seems about right.


## Power Connections

Drill more holes if you need.
